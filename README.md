# About
Sharpen is a framework for creating Discord bots which purpose is to respond to
commands issued in the Discord chatrooms. Sharpen has been developed in
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), based on the [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
interface and highly inspired from the [Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando)
and the [Aka√Øro](https://github.com/1Computer1/discord-akairo) frameworks while
adding a bunch of new features.

## Main Features
- Customizable prefixes per-guild
	(manage different settings per guild or globally, including command prefixes)
- Highly customizable framework
	(YOU decide how your bot will behave)
- Persistent storage of settings in database
	(shipped with built-in SQLite support)
- Almost-automatic translation of messages sent to the chat
	(talk to your bot in French or in English, and switch language anytime with a single command)
- Automatic prompting for invalid command arguments
	(rule #1: never trust the end users)

# Usage
Once deployed and running, the bot will parse messages to find commands to execute.
For the bot to recognized a command, a message should start with the current command
prefix or with a mention to the bot, followed by the command itself.

The `help` command is available to provide more information about the commands the
bot can respond to.

## Examples
Assuming the command prefix is `!`, typing `!ping` in the Discord channel will
trigger the ping command.

Since the prefix is customizable per-guild, it might as well be several characters
long. In that case, the prefix and the command should be separated by a space: `sharp ping`
(assuming the prefix would be `sharp`).

It is also possible to totally disable the prefix, meaning the bot will only respond
if mentioned at the start of the message (that method would always be available,
even if a prefix is set). For instance, `@Sharpbot#1234 ping` will trigger the ping
command.

Last but not least, the bot is also capable of handling direct messages (DMs).
While called in a DM, the bot will automatically try to parse the command even if there
is no prefix and if it's not been mentioned.

## Built-in Commands
A few commands have been pre-registered to speed up your bot's development. However,
your are totally free not to use them or overwrite them in your own project.
